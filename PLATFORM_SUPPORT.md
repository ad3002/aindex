  - Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
  - Native ARM64 optimizations
  - Full C++ backend functionality
  - Installation: `pip install aindex2`

- **Linux x86_64** 
  - Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
  - Standard Intel/AMD processors
  - Full C++ backend functionality
  - Installation: `pip install aindex2`

## Alternative Installation Methods

### üî® Build from Source
For platforms not covered by pre-built wheels:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ad3002/aindex.git
cd aindex
make all  # or 'make arm64' for Apple Silicon
pip install .
```

**Requirements for building from source:**
- C++ compiler (g++ or clang)
- make
- Python development headers
- pybind11 (automatically installed)

### üê≥ Docker
Use Docker for consistent environment across platforms:

```bash
docker run -it --rm python:3.11-slim bash
pip install aindex2
```

### üíª Windows Support
Windows users have several options:

1. **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** - Recommended
   ```bash
   # In WSL Ubuntu terminal
   pip install aindex2
   ```

2. **Docker Desktop**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm python:3.11 bash
   pip install aindex2
   ```

3. **Build from source** (requires Visual Studio Build Tools)

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Environments
AIndex works in cloud environments:

- **Google Colab**: `!pip install aindex2`
- **Jupyter Hub/Lab**: `!pip install aindex2`
- **GitHub Codespaces**: `pip install aindex2`

## Performance Notes

- **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)**: Best performance with native ARM64 optimizations
- **Linux x86_64**: Excellent performance with standard optimizations
- **Other platforms**: May have reduced performance when building from source
